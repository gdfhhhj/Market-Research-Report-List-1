<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Steering Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Steering</li><li>Manual Steering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bus steering systems market consists of two main types: power steering and manual steering. Power steering relies on hydraulic or electric systems to assist the driver in turning the wheels, reducing the effort required. It offers smoother handling and easier maneuverability. On the other hand, manual steering relies solely on the driver's physical strength to turn the wheels, without any mechanical assistance. While it requires more effort, some drivers prefer the direct control and simplicity of manual steering. Both types have their pros and cons, catering to different preferences and needs in the bus industry.</p></p>
