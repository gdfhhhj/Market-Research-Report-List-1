<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive LiDAR Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lidar</li><li>Solid State Lidar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive LiDAR Scanner market consists of two main types: Mechanical LiDAR and Solid State LiDAR. Mechanical LiDAR scanners utilize moving parts, such as rotating mirrors or spinning lasers, to generate a 3D map of the surroundings. They are known for their long-range capabilities and high accuracy but can be bulky and less durable. On the other hand, Solid State LiDAR scanners use non-moving components like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or optical phased arrays to provide a 3D perception of the environment. They are more compact, reliable, and cost-effective, but may have limitations in terms of range and performance.</p></p>
