<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coarse Bubble Membrane Diffuser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Diffuser</li><li>Tube Diffuser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coarse bubble membrane diffusers are widely used in wastewater treatment processes to enhance oxygen transfer efficiency. There are two main types of these diffusers: disc diffusers and tube diffusers. Disc diffusers consist of a central plate with multiple slots where the air passes through in large bubbles. Tube diffusers, on the other hand, have cylindrical structures with small holes along their length for air release. Both types improve oxygen transfer by breaking down larger bubbles into smaller ones, increasing the contact area with water and promoting efficient aeration in wastewater treatment systems.</p></p>
