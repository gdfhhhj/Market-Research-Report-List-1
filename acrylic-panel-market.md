<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Panel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extruded Acrylic Panel</li><li>Cast Acrylic Panel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acrylic panel market is comprised of two main types: extruded acrylic panel and cast acrylic panel. Extruded acrylic panel is produced by heating the acrylic material and forcing it through a die, resulting in a sheet of uniform thickness. It is more affordable and commonly used in applications where high optical clarity is not a priority. On the other hand, cast acrylic panel is made by pouring liquid acrylic into a mold and allowing it to harden. It offers superior optical clarity and is often used in applications where visual aesthetics are crucial, but it is more expensive than extruded acrylic panel.</p></p>
