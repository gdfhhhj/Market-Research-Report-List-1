<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotation Laser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Rotation Laser</li><li>Automatic Rotation Laser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotation laser market consists of two main types: manual rotation lasers and automatic rotation lasers. Manual rotation lasers require human intervention to manually rotate the laser beam, making them suitable for smaller-scale projects where a high level of precision is not required. On the other hand, automatic rotation lasers do not require human intervention as they automatically rotate the laser beam. These lasers are more commonly used in larger construction projects that demand a higher level of accuracy and efficiency.</p></p>
