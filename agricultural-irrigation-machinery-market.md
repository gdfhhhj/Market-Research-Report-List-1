<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Irrigation Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sprinkler Irrigation</li><li>Drip Irrigation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural irrigation machinery refers to the equipment used to distribute water in agricultural fields. There are two main types of agricultural irrigation machinery: sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation. Sprinkler irrigation involves the use of sprinkler systems to evenly distribute water over crops, resembling rainfall. Drip irrigation, on the other hand, utilizes a network of tubes and emitters to deliver water directly to the roots of plants, conserving water and reducing evaporation. Both types of irrigation machinery play a crucial role in enhancing crop productivity and ensuring efficient water usage in agriculture.</p></p>
