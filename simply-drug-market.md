<p><strong>The Simply Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brand Drugs</li><li>Generic Drug</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Brand drugs are medications that are developed and marketed by a specific pharmaceutical company under a unique name and patent protection. These drugs are expensive due to the high cost associated with research and development. Generic drugs, on the other hand, are produced once the patent on a brand drug expires. They have the same active ingredients and effectiveness as brand drugs but are sold at a lower price since the manufacturers don't have to invest in research. Generic drugs make healthcare more affordable for consumers.</p></p>
