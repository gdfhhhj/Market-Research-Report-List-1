<p><p>Self-expanding stents are medical devices used in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. These stents are designed to open up blocked or narrowed blood vessels by applying gentle, continuous pressure. Unlike traditional stents, self-expanding stents are made from alloy materials like nitinol, which allows them to expand and contract in response to body temperature changes.</p><p>The global self-expanding stents market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. A key market driver is the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, particularly among the aging population. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year.</p><p>Additionally, advancements in stent technology, such as bioresorbable stents, are expected to contribute to market growth. These stents dissolve over time, eliminating the need for long-term stent presence and reducing the risk of complications.</p><p>North America currently dominates the self-expanding stents market due to well-established healthcare infrastructure and high adoption rates of advanced medical technologies. Europe is also a significant market, driven by increasing cardiovascular disease cases and favorable reimbursement policies.</p><p>The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness rapid growth in the self-expanding stents market during the forecast period. Factors such as the rising geriatric population, increasing healthcare expenditure, and improving healthcare infrastructure in countries like India and China contribute to market expansion.</p><p>In conclusion, the self-expanding stents market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% during the forecast period. Factors such as the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and technological advancements in stent technology are expected to drive market growth globally, with North America and Europe leading the market currently.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Expanding Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vascular Stent</li><li>Non-vascular Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-expanding stents refer to medical devices used to treat narrowing or blockages in blood vessels. There are two main types of self-expanding stents: vascular stents and non-vascular stents. Vascular stents are specifically designed for use in the blood vessels, such as those in the heart or legs, to improve blood flow and prevent complications. Non-vascular stents, on the other hand, are used in other parts of the body, such as the esophagus or the airways, to keep them open and allow normal function. Both types of stents are crucial in medical interventions to restore or maintain proper bodily functions.</p></p>
