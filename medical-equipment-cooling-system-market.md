<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Equipment Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid-based Cooling System</li><li>Air-based Cooling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical equipment cooling system market can be classified into two types: liquid-based cooling system and air-based cooling system. Liquid-based cooling systems rely on the circulation of liquids, such as water or coolants, to remove heat from the medical equipment. These systems are efficient and ideal for cooling high-power and temperature-sensitive equipment. On the other hand, air-based cooling systems use airflow to cool the medical equipment. These systems are cost-effective but may not be as efficient as liquid-based systems for certain applications.</p></p>
