<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specialty Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specialty tire market includes two main types: radial tires and bias (crossply) tires. Radial tires are constructed with the cords of the tire carcass running radially from bead to bead, creating a flexible and durable tire that provides better fuel efficiency and handling. Bias (crossply) tires have cords that crisscross diagonally from bead to bead, which makes the tire stiffer and less flexible. These tires are ideal for heavy-duty applications and off-road use due to their strength and resistance to punctures.</p></p>
