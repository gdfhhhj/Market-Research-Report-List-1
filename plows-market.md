<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plows Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional</li><li>Reversible</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Plows are agricultural implements used for soil turning or clearing snow. There are two main types of plows: conventional and reversible. Conventional plows are designed for one-directional use, meaning they work in a single forward direction. On the other hand, reversible plows are specifically designed to work in two directions, both forward and backward. This allows for greater efficiency and convenience, as they eliminate the need for turning the plow around. Both types of plows serve the purpose of preparing the soil for planting or clearing snow, but reversible plows offer added versatility.</p></p>
