<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Cars Friction Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brake Linings</li><li>Brake Pads</li><li>Clutch Facings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger cars friction material market consists of three main types: brake linings, brake pads, and clutch facings. Brake linings are materials that are attached to the brake shoe and help to create friction for stopping the vehicle. Brake pads function similarly but are directly attached to the brake caliper. Clutch facings are materials used in the clutch system to create friction between the clutch disc and flywheel, allowing for smooth gear shifting. All three types of friction materials play crucial roles in ensuring the safety and functionality of passenger cars.</p></p>
