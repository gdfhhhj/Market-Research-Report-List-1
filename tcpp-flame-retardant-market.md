<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TCPP Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Degradation</li><li>Dilution of Gas Phase</li><li>Gas Phase Radical Quenching</li><li>Thermal Shielding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TCPP Flame Retardant Market involves different types of flame retardant mechanisms. </p><p>1. Endothermic Degradation is a process where the flame retardant absorbs heat from the surrounding environment, reducing the temperature of the material and delaying its ignition.</p><p>2. Dilution of Gas Phase occurs when the flame retardant releases non-flammable gases that dilute the flammable gases in the environment, thus reducing the chance of ignition.</p><p>3. Gas Phase Radical Quenching involves the flame retardant neutralizing the free radicals present in the gas phase, preventing further combustion reactions.</p><p>4. Thermal Shielding refers to the flame retardant forming a protective layer on the material's surface, which acts as a barrier against heat transfer and protects the underlying material from ignition.</p></p>
