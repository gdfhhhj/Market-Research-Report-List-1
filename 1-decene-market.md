<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1-Decene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oligomerization Method</li><li>Cracking Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 1-Decene market can be divided into two types based on the methods used for its production. Oligomerization method involves the catalytic reaction of ethylene gas to produce 1-Decene. This method is preferred for its flexibility to control the product's properties. On the other hand, the cracking method involves the thermal decomposition of crude oil or natural gas to obtain 1-Decene. This process is widely used due to its cost-effectiveness and high yield. Both methods contribute to the overall production and supply of 1-Decene in the market.</p></p>
