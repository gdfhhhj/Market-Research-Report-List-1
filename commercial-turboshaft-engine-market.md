<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Turboshaft Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Presure</li><li>Low Presure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial turboshaft engine market can be divided into two types based on pressure levels: high pressure and low pressure. High-pressure engines are designed to produce higher power output by compressing air more efficiently, resulting in improved performance. On the other hand, low-pressure engines prioritize fuel efficiency and reliability over power output. They operate at lower compression ratios, which reduces stress on components and increases their longevity. These two types cater to different needs and requirements of commercial aircraft operators in terms of power and efficiency.</p></p>
