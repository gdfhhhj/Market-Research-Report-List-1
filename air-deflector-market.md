<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Deflector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Molding</li><li>Vacuum Forming</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Air Deflector market can be categorized into three types: Casting, Molding, and Vacuum Forming. In the casting process, molten material is poured into a mold to create the air deflector shape. Molding involves shaping the material using a mold that is filled with a liquid or semi-liquid substance which solidifies. Vacuum Forming is a process where a heated sheet of material is placed over a mold, and then suction is applied to form it into the desired shape. These methods are commonly used in the production of air deflectors for various applications.</p></p>
