<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tubular Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane Bioreactor</li><li>Reverse Osmosis</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The tubular membranes market includes two primary types: membrane bioreactor and reverse osmosis. Membrane bioreactor is a technology that combines a membrane separation process with a biological process to treat wastewater. It removes contaminants and produces high-quality water fit for reuse. On the other hand, reverse osmosis is a filtration method that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from water, allowing the production of clean drinking water or desalination of seawater. Both technologies play a crucial role in water treatment and purification.</p></p>
