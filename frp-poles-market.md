<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP Poles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filament Winding</li><li>Pultrusion</li><li>Centrifugal Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) poles market can be categorized into three types - Filament Winding, Pultrusion, and Centrifugal Casting. Filament Winding involves the process of winding continuous fibers on a mandrel, creating strong and durable poles. Pultrusion involves pulling continuous fiber reinforcements through a resin bath and then shaping them into poles using heated molds. Centrifugal Casting involves spinning a mold at high speeds while pouring the resin, allowing it to evenly distribute and form the pole shape. These different methods offer varying advantages and are utilized based on specific needs and requirements.</p></p>
