<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Rigid Board Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Rigid Boards</li><li>Rigid Boards</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fiberglass Rigid Board Insulation market offers two main types of products: Semi-Rigid Boards and Rigid Boards. Semi-Rigid Boards are more flexible than Rigid Boards but still maintain a certain degree of rigidity. They are suitable for insulating irregular surfaces or structures with curved shapes. Rigid Boards, on the other hand, are less flexible and more rigid, making them ideal for applications that require a higher level of strength and durability. Both types of boards provide thermal insulation, noise reduction, and energy efficiency benefits.</p></p>
