<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spring Isolators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Supported</li><li>Hanging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spring isolators are devices designed to reduce vibration and noise in various applications. There are two common types of spring isolators: supported isolators and hanging isolators. Supported isolators are installed directly under the equipment to isolate it from the structure. They are used in applications where the equipment is heavy or has a large footprint. Hanging isolators, on the other hand, are suspended from the structure to isolate the equipment. They are typically used in applications where the equipment is lighter or has a smaller footprint. Both types of isolators effectively minimize vibrations and offer improved performance and durability.</p></p>
