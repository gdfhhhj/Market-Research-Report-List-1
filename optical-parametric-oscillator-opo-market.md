<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Resonance</li><li>Double Resonance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) market can be categorized into single resonance and double resonance types. In a single resonance OPO, a pump laser beam creates an oscillation in a nonlinear crystal, while a signal and idler beam are generated. This type is simpler and cheaper but produces lower output powers. On the other hand, a double resonance OPO uses an additional resonator that enhances the conversion efficiency, resulting in higher output powers. However, it is more complex and expensive compared to the single resonance OPO.</p></p>
