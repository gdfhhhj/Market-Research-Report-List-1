<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Storage and Offloading (FPSO) Vessels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Newbuilding</li><li>Converted from Ships</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels are used in the offshore oil and gas industry to store and offload extracted hydrocarbons. The market for these vessels can be divided into two types â€“ newbuilding and vessels converted from ships. Newbuilding refers to FPSO vessels that are purpose-built from scratch, designed and constructed specifically for the oil and gas industry. Converted from ships, on the other hand, means that existing ships are modified and converted into FPSO vessels. Both types serve the same purpose of storing and offloading hydrocarbons but differ in terms of the vessel's origin.</p></p>
