<p><strong>The Detachable Embolization Coils Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arterial Vessel Embolization</li><li>Venous Vessel Embolization</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Detachable embolization coils are utilized in medical procedures to treat arterial vessel embolization and venous vessel embolization. Arterial vessel embolization involves the use of coils to block abnormal blood flow in arteries, addressing conditions like aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. On the other hand, venous vessel embolization employs coils to obstruct dysfunctional veins, such as in the treatment of varicoceles or venous malformations. Both techniques aim to promote blood flow redirection and decrease the risk of complications associated with abnormal vessel structures.</p></p>
