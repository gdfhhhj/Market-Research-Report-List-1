<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sewage Sludge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Raw primary sludge</li><li>Secondary sludge</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The sewage sludge market consists of two main types: raw primary sludge and secondary sludge. Raw primary sludge is the thick, heavy material that settles at the bottom during primary treatment of wastewater. It contains organic matter and is typically high in moisture content. On the other hand, secondary sludge is produced during secondary treatment processes, where biological or chemical methods are used to further breakdown the wastewater contaminants. It is usually less concentrated and contains a higher proportion of organic and inorganic solids. Both types of sludge have various applications in agriculture, energy production, and waste management industries.</p></p>
