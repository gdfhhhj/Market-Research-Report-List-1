<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Breathing Technological Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure</li><li>Negative-pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive breathing technological market includes two main types: positive-pressure and negative-pressure devices. Positive-pressure devices, such as CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machines, deliver air or oxygen under pressure into the patient's airways to keep them open. Negative-pressure devices, like iron lungs or chest cuirasses, create a vacuum around the patient's chest, causing the lungs to expand and allowing air to be drawn in. Both types of devices are used to assist patients with respiratory problems without the need for invasive procedures like intubation.</p></p>
