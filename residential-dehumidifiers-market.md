<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Dehumidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical/ Refrigerative Dehumidifiers</li><li>Desiccant Dehumidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Residential dehumidifiers are appliances used to reduce the level of humidity in the air within a home. There are two main types: mechanical/refrigerative dehumidifiers and desiccant dehumidifiers. Mechanical dehumidifiers work by drawing warm, moist air over a cold coil, causing the moisture to condense and collect in a reservoir. Desiccant dehumidifiers, on the other hand, use a moisture-absorbing material like silica gel to remove humidity from the air. Both types effectively reduce humidity levels, but they employ different mechanisms to achieve this.</p></p>
