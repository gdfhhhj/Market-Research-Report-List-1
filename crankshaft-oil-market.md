<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crankshaft Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Semi-Solid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Crankshaft oil is available in two main market types: liquid and semi-solid. Liquid crankshaft oil refers to the traditional form of oil that flows freely and smoothly, providing lubrication and cooling to the engine components. On the other hand, semi-solid crankshaft oil has a thicker consistency, almost gel-like, and provides enhanced protection and lubrication. It is designed for high-performance engines or vehicles operating under extreme conditions where increased viscosity is required for better stability and resistance to breakdown. Both types are used to ensure proper functioning and longevity of the engine parts.</p></p>
