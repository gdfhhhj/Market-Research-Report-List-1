<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter</li><li>Non-Contact Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter market comprises two types: Contact Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter and Non-Contact Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter. The Contact Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter involves physical contact with the cornea to measure its thickness, providing accurate readings. On the other hand, the Non-Contact Ultrasonic Corneal Pachymeter works without touching the cornea, using air pulses or optical methods to measure the thickness. This type offers convenience and reduces the risk of corneal injury. Both types serve the purpose of measuring corneal thickness, but differ in their usage methods.</p></p>
