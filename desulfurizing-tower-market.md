<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desulfurizing Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Scrubbers</li><li>Wet Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desulfurizing tower market includes two main types: dry scrubbers and wet scrubbers. Dry scrubbers are air pollution control devices that use a dry reagent or sorbent to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from exhaust gases. They are generally more cost-effective and require less maintenance than wet scrubbers. Wet scrubbers, on the other hand, use a liquid solution to collect and remove pollutants. They are typically more efficient in removing pollutants but can be more expensive and require more maintenance. Both types play a crucial role in reducing sulfur emissions and improving air quality.</p></p>
