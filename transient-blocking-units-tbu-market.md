<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transient Blocking Units (TBU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bidirectional Transient Blocking Units</li><li>Unidirectional Transient Blocking Units</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transient Blocking Units (TBU) are devices used to protect electronic circuits from voltage surges and transients. There are two main types of TBU markets: bidirectional and unidirectional. Bidirectional TBUs can block surges in both directions of current flow, making them suitable for applications where current flow may change direction. Unidirectional TBUs, on the other hand, only allow surges to be blocked in one direction, typically used in applications where current flow is limited to one direction. Both types of TBUs provide effective protection against transient events in electronic systems.</p></p>
