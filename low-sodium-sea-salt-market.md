<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Sodium Sea Salt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Sea Salt</li><li>Dry Sea Salt</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The low sodium sea salt market is divided into two types: wet sea salt and dry sea salt. Wet sea salt is harvested from sea water by evaporating it, leaving behind the salt crystals along with some moisture. It retains a slightly moist texture and is often used for cooking. Dry sea salt, on the other hand, is obtained by further drying the wet sea salt, resulting in a completely dry and granular texture. It is commonly used as a table salt or for seasoning foods. Both types of sea salt offer a low sodium alternative to regular salt.</p></p>
