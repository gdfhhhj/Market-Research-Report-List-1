<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Locking Automotive Gas Spring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Damper</li><li>Dynamic Dampler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-locking automotive gas spring market comprises two prominent types - hydraulic damper and dynamic damper. Hydraulic dampers utilize a hydraulic fluid to absorb and dampen the energy generated from the movement of the spring. This helps to provide a smooth and controlled motion in automotive applications. On the other hand, dynamic dampers employ a combination of gas and oil to dampen and control the spring's motion, ensuring stability and comfort while driving. These two types play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and safety of automotive vehicles.</p></p>
