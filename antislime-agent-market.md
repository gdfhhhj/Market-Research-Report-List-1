<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antislime Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Oxidising Type</li><li>Oxidising Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Antislime agents are used to prevent the growth of slime in various industries. There are two main categories of antislime agents: Non-Oxidising Type and Oxidising Type. Non-Oxidising Type antislime agents work by inhibiting slime formation without affecting the oxidizing-reducing balance. These agents are commonly used in applications where oxidizing agents may be harmful. On the other hand, Oxidising Type antislime agents work by oxidizing and controlling the growth of slime. They are typically used in systems that tolerate oxidizing agents and require a more aggressive approach in slime prevention.</p></p>
