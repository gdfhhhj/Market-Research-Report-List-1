<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant PBT Granules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flame retardant PBT granules refer to a type of plastic material that has been treated with specific chemicals to reduce its flammability. There are two main types of flame retardant PBT granules in the market: halogen type and halogen-free type. The halogen type contains halogen-based compounds, such as bromine or chlorine, which release gases when exposed to heat to suppress the flame. On the other hand, the halogen-free type does not contain any halogen-based compounds but utilizes alternative flame-retardant mechanisms to limit the spread of fire. Both types aim to provide fire safety in various applications.</p></p>
